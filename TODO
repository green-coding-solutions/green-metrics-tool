  1. rename current configuration.js to dashboard_settings.js
  2. All domain calls should use a variable from the config.js file
     that is set through install.sh script. the domain
     to be used is given in the config.yml file
  3. config.js should be ignored in git
  4. documentation has to be added
  5. grep for any occurrence of "green-coding"  to remove all domain
     mentions from the checked in code (apart from
     config.yml.example of course)
