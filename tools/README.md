## What is in here?

The tools folder contains all scripts that are mainly used as stand-alone CLI programs.

For instance `prune_db.py` to clear the DB manually.

Some files have also counterparts in the *lib* directory where they include functionality from.
An example would be the `phase_stats.py` which is often included, but in some cases also needs a *tools* CLI to be
invoked manually.
