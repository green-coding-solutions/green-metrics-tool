This metrics reporter can read from the Picolog HRDL ADC-24 when it is instrumented via the Streaming feature.

The static-binary file can be used as usual by giving the -i argument with the resolution.

The file however does not start unless you set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to this directory.
This is only a hotfix and will be corrected shortly.

This README is mostly a placeholder to have the info for the fix at hand.
