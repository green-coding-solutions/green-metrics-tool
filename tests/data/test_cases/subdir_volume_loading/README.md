This repo investigates volume loading in `docker compose`

Different `testfile*` files are in the subdir and its subfolders. They are tried to loaded without a further path
to check if docker compose on some systems will find them based on the location of the `compose.yaml` or 
even based on the build context.

## Try

Run `docker compose up --build`.

```

You will then see a listing of the file system that shows that all the files that are loaded without setting the 
path relative to the `compose.yaml` will be falsely mounted as empty directories.

Furthermore docker will create empty directories on your host system.
