### This discusses how the entrypoint and command work together

  # Short ENTRYPOINT + Short COMMAND
  short-entrypoint-short-command:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint: echo "A $0"
    command: echo "B $0"
  # -> This executes echo and then "A $0" 'echo' "B $0"

  short-entrypoint-short-command-env:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint: env
    command: env
  # -> This executes env with the parameter env

  short-entrypoint-short-command-env-with-param:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint: env
    command: -h
  # -> As proven here

# Now we want to check if long forms make a difference

  # Short ENTRYPOINT + Long COMMAND
  short-entrypoint-long-command:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint: echo "A $0"
    command:
      - echo
      - "B $0"
  # -> This is the same output as the short form

  # Long ENTRYPOINT + Short COMMAND
  long-entrypoint-short-command:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint:
      - echo
      - "A $0"
    command: echo "B $0"
  # -> same here

  # Long ENTRYPOINT + Long COMMAND
  long-entrypoint-long-command:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint:
      - echo
      - "A $0"
    command:
      - echo
      - "B $0"
  # -> This again executes echo and puts the rest as commands output is  'A $0 echo B $0'

  # Now we want to see how env looks like in a shell
  no-entrypoint-short-command:
    image: alpine
    command: ash -c 'env'

  no-entrypoint-short-command2:
    image: alpine
    command: env
  # -> We can see that the ash shell (default in alpine) adds some vars


  # No ENTRYPOINT + Long COMMAND
  no-entrypoint-long-command:
    image: alpine
    command:
      - echo
      - $0
  # -> This also doesn't create a shell. It calls shell with '$0'

  # No ENTRYPOINT + Long COMMAND
  no-entrypoint-long-command-escaped:
    image: alpine
    command:
      - echo
      - $$0
  # -> Maybe there is some escaping going on. No the output is the same

  # Short ENTRYPOINT + No COMMAND Just checking
  short-entrypoint-no-command:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint: echo $0

  # 8) Long ENTRYPOINT + No COMMAND
  long-entrypoint-no-command:
    image: alpine
    entrypoint:
      - echo
      - "A $0"

  # Finally maybe you need to create a string
  no-entrypoint-short-command-string:
    image: alpine
    command: 'echo $0'
  # -> This is split (output is $0). So echo is executed and $0 is the param
