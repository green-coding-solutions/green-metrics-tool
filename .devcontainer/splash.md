## Green Metrics Tool Codespaces Quickstart

Thank you for trying out the Green Metrics Tool :-)

Please run `bash .devcontainer/workshop/codespace-setup.sh` to set up everything! ðŸš€

It will take about 3 minutes.

Load the env: `source venv/bin/activate`

Do your first run like this: `python3 runner.py --name "Simple Test" --uri /workspaces/green-metrics-tool/example-applications/stress/ --skip-system-checks --dev-no-optimizations --dev-no-build`

Then, if you want to see a more representative repository, try running the repository set up for the Wagtail CMS Bakery Demo - to demonstrate  testing a series of more complicated user journeys.

`python3 runner.py --uri https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/bakerydemo-gold-benchmark/ --skip-system-checks --dev-no-optimization --dev-no-build --skip-unsafe --name "Bakery Demo Test"`

To see the Metrics front end, go to your ports tab and follow the forwarding address for port 9143
